# newton-rhapson-method

The Newton-Raphson method is an iterative algorithm used to find the roots of a function. The method uses the derivative of the function to calculate successive approximations to the root, which converge to the actual root of the function.

The method starts with an initial guess for the root, and then uses the formula:

> x_{n+1} = x_n - f(x_n) / f'(x_n)

where x_n is the current approximation to the root, f(x_n) is the value of the function at x_n, and f'(x_n) is the derivative of the function evaluated at x_n. The formula calculates the next approximation x_{n+1} by finding the intersection of the tangent line to the function at x_n with the x-axis.

The process is repeated until the desired level of accuracy is achieved. The Newton-Raphson method is a powerful tool for finding roots of functions, but it can be sensitive to the initial guess and may not converge if the function is not well-behaved near the root.
